# Ghreti
My latest game project starting from scratch using python 3.7.1 and pygame2.0.0.dev6
The game itself is planned to be a procedurally-generated-wall-climbing-2d-platformer
collect fruit to earn upgrades as you play through levels generated for your amusement.
# So whats done?
some basic player animations are working, the camera module works pretty well with scaling and all.
player movement and wall jumping mechanic works, though it still needs tweaking. 
i've been testing the viability of levels created with the generator and i think i've found a good way to do it. 
# what's coming next?
a scoring a saving system to track the amount of fruit you collect
a leveling system to generate harder levels as you go on. 
sound effects 
more animations!
some music.
the ability to lose the game
